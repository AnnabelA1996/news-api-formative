    <h2>A Little Bit About The Project</h2>
    <p>My name is Annabel and I am studying level 6 Web Development and UX Design through YOOBEE Colleges in Christchurch. This Project is part of an assessment where the brief outlines creating an app that fetches data from an API (in this case the news API) that can also display filtered categories to the user.

    The brief also required that we use a Javascript framework or User Interface Library to create this singe page application. The framework I have selected is Vue and I have implemented styling using a CSS framework called Bulma.
